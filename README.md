# DataStructures(python)

# Built-in DataStructures

## Array
  It is a collections of data type stored contiguous memory locations(ordered collections of values)

      operation run time complexity
      - Insertion : O(n)
      - Deletion : O(n)
      - accessing by index: O(1)
      - Append : O(1)

## Hash Table or dictionary
  It is unordered data structure that stores pairs of key-value

      operation run time complexity
      - accessing by key : O(1)
      - Insertion: O(1)
      - Deletion: O(1)

## tuple
   It is ordered collection of data type and being used for immutable things (that don't change).
     
     operation run time complexity
     - access by index O(1)

## sets
  It is unorederd collection of unique elements.
    
    operation run time complexity
     - Insertion: O(1)
     - Deletion: O(1)


# self-defined DataStructures

## Linked Lists
  A linked list is a common data structure made of one or more than one node. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the previous/next node forming the chain-like structure

        operation run time complexity
        - prepend O(1)
        - append O(1)
        - lookup O(n)
        - insert O(n)
        - delete O(n)
        
  # singly linked list
    a linear data structure comprising of nodes chained together in a single direction. Each node contains a data member holding useful information, and a pointer to the next node. Can traverse forward
  # Doubly linked list
    A doubly linked list contains a pointer to the next node as well as the previous node. This ensures that the list can be traversed in both directions.

# Stacks
  Stack is a linear data structure in which the element inserted last is the element to be deleted first.

      operation run time complexity
      - push O(1)
      - pop O(1)

# Tree

# Graph
